UTF-8 Encoding and issues with VisualC++
----------------------------------------

By default, all source files are UTF-8 files.

Microsoft doesn't play nice with UTF-8. UTF-16 little-endian is the encoding standard at Microsoft and in the Windows OS.
Expect significant difficulty if you insist on using UTF-8 files in Visual C++.
Since UTF-16 works fine, convert arrowdata.h, font.cpp and fontdata.h to UTF-16 LE. Use notepad++ {Encoding}{Convert to UCS-2 Little Endian}.
UCS-2 is an older compatible version of UTF-16. This conversion adds a BOM mark to the beginning of the file that indicates the encoding type and endian.
All ordinary 8-bit characters are converted to 16-bit charactes starting with \00. More info at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688113.aspx.

Move the SDL_sgui directory into your SDL directory.
Create an empty SDL_getenv.h file in SDL_sgui/include/SDL
